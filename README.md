# Power BI Dashboards Catalog
Welcome to the Power BI Dashboards Catalog repository! This repository showcases a collection of interactive Power BI dashboards that I have created. Each dashboard is organized in its own directory, containing the Power BI file and a README file with an explanation of the dashboard, its purpose, and the data used.

## Available Dashboards
- Public Investment
- Fishing activity
- Health and Education

## How to Use
To explore a specific dashboard:
- Browse the repository and click on the directory of the dashboard you're interested in.
- Download the dashboard.pbix file to your local machine.
- Open the file using Power BI Desktop to explore the data and visualizations.
- Review the README.md file within that directory for detailed information about the dashboard, including data sources, key insights, and any instructions.
